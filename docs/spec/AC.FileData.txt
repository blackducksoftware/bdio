# Appendix C: File Data

## File System Types

This section is normative.

| File System Type         | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `regular`                | A regular file, typically of unknown content. |
| `regular/binary`         | A regular file with executable content. |
| `regular/text`           | A regular file with known text content. Should be accompanied by an encoding. |
| `directory`              | A directory entry which may or may not contain children. |
| `directory/archive`      | An archive which may or may not contain children. Can also be treated as a regular file. |
| `symlink`                | A symbolic link. Should be accompanied by a link target. |
| `other/device/block`     | A block device, like a drive. |
| `other/device/character` | A character device, like a terminal. |
| `other/door`             | A door used for interprocess communication. |
| `other/pipe`             | A named pipe. |
| `other/socket`           | A socket. |
| `other/whiteout`         | A whiteout, or file removal in a layered file system. |

NOTE: File system types are compared case-insensitively.


## Recommended Fingerprint Digest Algorithms

| Algorithm | Expected Hex String Length  | Description |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| md5       | 32                          | MD5 |
| sha1      | 40                          | SHA-1 |
| sha256    | 64                          | SHA-2, SHA-256 |

NOTE: Algorithms are compared case-insensitively.


## Recommended File Path Archive Schemes

| Scheme    | Slash Required | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| `zip`     | No             | ZIP |
| `jar`     | No             | Java Archive |
| `tar`     | No             | Tape Archive |
| `rpm`     | No             | RPM Package Manager |
| `ar`      | No             | Unix archiver |
| `arj`     | No             | ARJ archives |
| `cpio`    | No             | Copy in and out |
| `dump`    | No             | Unix dump |
| `sevenz`  | No             | 7-Zip |
| `rar`     | Yes            | Roshal Archive |
| `xar`     | Yes            | Extensible Archive |
| `phar`    | Yes            | PHP Archive |
| `cab`     | Yes            | Cabinet |
| `unknown` | Yes            | Used when the actual scheme is not known |

NOTE: File extensions and/or compression formats are not accounted for using the scheme, e.g. a file with the extension ".tgz" or ".tar.gz" still has a scheme of "tar".
